Changes include deletion of all zip ties, use of heatsets instead of threading screws into plastic,
captive bearing design, belt clamps and tensioners, and Peeler and display housing to stiffen assembly.

It also uses 200mm x 3mm rods for the Y-axis instead of the standard 150mm supplied with the kit.
